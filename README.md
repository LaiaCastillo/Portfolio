# Project with an Api of videoGames
In this project, I have created an API that manages video games and a client (Razor pages) that connects to it to create a user-friendly web page.
I Implemented user authentication with tokens, and permission with roles.

## Added Features:

- BDD

- Game list

- User login and registration

- Admin login and registration

- Role and permission management

- Online chat

- User profile

- Game details page

- Add games

- View voted games in your profile

## Features not added:

- The voting option does not work on the client, but it works fine on the API.

- No default games are added.

## Libraries Used:
- .Net

- User Identity

- Entity Framework

- Token-based authorization

- Swagger

- SignalR

- Asynchronous functions
  
- Razor pages
